# Rock,Paper,Scissors-----Brainnest
This is the final product of my previous <a href="https://github.com/Spottie97/JS-Assignment-----Brainnest">assignment</a>. You can access and test out the game <a href="https://spottie97.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors-----Brainnest/">here</a>

## What did I add
- I added a UI so instead of using text to play the game you now click buttons.
- I updated the way the game works, you now play until one of the players reaches 5 points, at that point the winner is announced and a reset button appears.
- After click the reset button, it will disappear and the game stats will be reset to 0.
- Added image to make the game look a bit better.
- Used CSS to add some color and life to the game.
